## JSON2Schema for JSON Editor
The user interface of the JSON Editor (https://www.github.com/niebert/json-editor) is defined by a JSON schema. JSON Editor takes a JSON Schema and uses it to generate an HTML form.  
It has full support for JSON Schema version 3 and 4 and can integrate with several popular CSS frameworks (bootstrap, foundation, and jQueryUI).

Check out an interactive demo (demo.html):

JSON Editor has no dependencies. It only needs a modern browser (tested in Chrome and Firefox).

If you want to alter the provided example of https://___PKG_GITHUBUSER___.github.io/___PKG_EXPORTVAR___ just make a copy of the `docs/`-folder in this repository `___PKG_EXPORTVAR___` and adapt the JSON-schema `docs/schema` and the JSON data in the folder `docs/db/` to the schema for your requirements. If you want to create your own JSON schema use the [JSON2Schema tool](https://niebert/github.io/JSON2Schema).
