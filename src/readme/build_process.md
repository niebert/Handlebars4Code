## Build Process of `npm run build`
The build process is called by `npm run build` which in turn call `build.js`. If you want to call the build process of `build.js` separately just call `build.js` with `node build.js` from the shell/console.

The templates for building the output are stored in the folder `src/`.

After the build process the `README.md` is generated and if you want to have the table of contents in the file for the concatenation of  files in `src/readme/` listed in `files4build.js` then you must run the DocToc generator for `README.md` by `doctoc README.md` from the shell to update the table of contents in `README.md`.
